# Mu Buttons

### New
![new button](/mu-help/images/new.png)

Click the new button to start in a new file in mu. This won't damage your old files. It is just a fresh place to work.

### Load
![load button](/mu-help/images/load.png)

Load a file. Continue working on a file you have stored locally. 

### Save
![save button](/mu-help/images/save.png)

Saves your work so you can keep it for later and not lose it if you lose power. This should be done regularly!

### Run
![run button](/mu-help/images/run.png)

Run your code on the Thunderboard Sense. This does not store the code on the board, and will be lost once the board is reset. 

### Files
![files button](/mu-help/images/files.png)

Show the files stored on your Thunderboard. To transfer the files to your board, just drag and drop them from "Files on your computer:" to "Files on your board:". main.py is the file that will run when the board is reset. Hence, to make your program start automatically after a reset, save your program as main.py before transferring it to the board. Other files you transfer to the board, can be imported into main.py following the Python standard. 

### Repl
